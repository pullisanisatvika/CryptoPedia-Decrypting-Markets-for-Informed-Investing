Explanation:

This is a JSON object containing key-value pairs.
The keys are long strings (likely hashes or unique identifiers).
The values are all true in this case.
Possible Interpretations:

Without more context about your project's structure, it's difficult to say definitively what this file represents. However, here are some possible interpretations:

Asset Manifest: This file could be an asset manifest generated by a build tool. The keys might be unique identifiers for assets (images, fonts, etc.) included in your app, and the true values could indicate that they are present and available.
Configuration Data: It could also be a simple configuration file where the keys are unique identifiers (perhaps for settings or features) and the true values indicate that they are enabled.
Recommendation:

If you have access to the code that reads or interacts with this file, examining that code would provide more insight into its purpose.
Look for documentation or comments within the project that might explain the meaning of asset.json and its contents.
